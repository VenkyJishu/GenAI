    "## Key metrics:\n",
    "### Precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision tells you how many of the predicted positive instances (fraud SMS in your case) are actually correct. It answers the question: Of all the instances that were predicted as fraud (1), how many were actually fraud?\n",
    "Precision for Class 0 (non-fraud): 0.99 means that 99% of the instances predicted as non-fraud were indeed non-fraud.\n",
    "Precision for Class 1 (fraud): 0.97 means that 97% of the instances predicted as fraud were indeed fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall measures how well the model identifies all the positive instances in the data. It answers the question: Of all the actual fraud instances (1), how many did the model correctly identify?\n",
    "Recall for Class 0 (non-fraud): 1.00 means that the model correctly identified 100% of the non-fraud SMS messages.\n",
    "Recall for Class 1 (fraud): 0.91 means that the model correctly identified 91% of the fraud SMS messages.\n",
    "### F1-Score:\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It combines both precision and recall into a single metric and is useful when you want to balance the trade-off between precision and recall.\n",
    "F1-score for Class 0 (non-fraud): 0.99 indicates excellent performance in terms of precision and recall for non-fraud instances.\n",
    "F1-score for Class 1 (fraud): 0.94 indicates a good balance between precision and recall for fraud instances, but it is slightly lower than for non-fraud, indicating room for improvement in identifying fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support:\n",
    "\n",
    "Support refers to the number of true instances for each class in the dataset.\n",
    "Support for Class 0 (non-fraud): 965 instances in the dataset are non-fraud.\n",
    "Support for Class 1 (fraud): 150 instances in the dataset are fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "The accuracy is the overall percentage of correct predictions (both fraud and non-fraud) out of all predictions.\n",
    "In your case, the accuracy is 0.98, meaning 98% of the model's predictions are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Averages:\n",
    "#### Macro Average:\n",
    "\n",
    "The macro average calculates the metric (precision, recall, F1) independently for each class and then averages them. This gives equal weight to each class, regardless of how many instances each class has.\n",
